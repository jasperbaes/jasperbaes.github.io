## Tenant Hijack / ransomware

Represents full compromise of the tenant.

**Attack Path:** Attackers have full ownership of the tenant. They can demand ransom, destroy the tenant, or exfiltrate all tenant and user data.

If you're locked out of your tenant, contact the Microsoft Data Protection team to get your tenant unlocked. You will need to prove your ownership of the tenant. Be prepared for a bit of a wait.
