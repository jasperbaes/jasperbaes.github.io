It offers actionable policy recommendations and supports continuous risk assessment with historical trends and insights.</p><p>Continuous Exposure Management looks incredibly promising—imagine Secure Score on steroids!

Some of these alternatives might even be sketchier when it comes to protecting your (sensitive) data. But don't worry, this post got your back! 👇</p><p>I've created up a simple guide that shows you how to create your very own private ChatGPT using Azure. No tech wizardry required – you can have it up and running in just 30 minutes! This setup makes sure your data takes a detour through a private AI model instance in Azure's OpenAI, so you're not sending your data through who-knows-where. Plus, authentication is provided with Entra. 🛡️</p><p>💰When it comes to costs, you may consider downsizing to an Azure CosmosDB Free Tier and utilizing a free/B1 Azure App Service.</p><p>Bing Enterprise (currently in preview) might also offer a solution. Here, prompt are send to Bing, but 'won't leak outside the organization'. Documentation is not clear about data processing outside of EU boundaries.</p>",
