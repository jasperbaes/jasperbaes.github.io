            "text": "<p>Guess what? Blocking A.I. sites like ChatGPT doesn't stop your users from finding other ways to chat it up with the machines. Some of these alternatives might even be sketchier when it comes to protecting your (sensitive) data. But don't worry, this post got your back! 👇</p><p>I've created up a simple guide that shows you how to create your very own private ChatGPT using Azure. No tech wizardry required – you can have it up and running in just 30 minutes! This setup makes sure your data takes a detour through a private AI model instance in Azure's OpenAI, so you're not sending your data through who-knows-where. Plus, authentication is provided with Azure AD. 🛡️</p><p>💰When it comes to costs, you may consider downsizing to an Azure CosmosDB Free Tier and utilizing a free/B1 Azure App Service.</p><p>Bing Enterprise (currently in preview) might also offer a solution. Here, prompt are send to Bing, but 'won't leak outside the organization'. Documentation is not clear about data processing outside of EU boundaries.</p>",

            "text": "<h3 class=\"font-weight-bold\">Why?</h3><p>  The first reason to create this online curriculum vitae and blog is because I want to learn and improve my  development skills in Angular and Angular Material. JavaScript and design  frameworks are frequently used nowadays and so I think it is useful to know the  basics of several. I've also had this 1-year free domain but I never used it for  something 'public', besides to host some temporary site projects. This way, I make optimal use of it.</p><p>  A second reason for this blog is because I wanted to share my experiences,  thoughts and reflections with certain programs, operating systems, ideas, concepts or  courses. Not that many of you will benefit from this, but it does helps me to  process and reflect certain topics.</p><h3 class=\"font-weight-bold\">Tell me more about Angular</h3><p>  Angular is a web framework developed by Google. Although it is not the most  used and popular JavaScript framework, I want to give it a try. A JavaScript  framework gives you a environment with pre-written code and techniques to use.  A front end framework allows you for example to use and re-use components.  Building a house with tools and pre-manufactured materials like bricks, wood  and cement is much more comfortable than creating your own building materials  from scratch without a schema or blueprint. Or am I wrong?</p><p>Here I will compare the 3 most popular JavaScript frameworks:</p><table class=\"table\">  <thead>    <tr>      <th scope=\"col\"></th>      <th scope=\"col\">Angular</th>      <th scope=\"col\">React</th>      <th scope=\"col\">Vue</th>    </tr>  </thead>  <tbody>    <tr>      <th scope=\"row\">Briefly</th>      <td>The complete package</td>      <td>Stable, requires lots of libraries</td>      <td>Lightweight and simple</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <th scope=\"row\">Popularity</th>      <td>Mhwaa, not that much</td>      <td>Yeah</td>      <td>Uhum, used a lot!</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <th scope=\"row\">Size and load time</th>      <td>Depends, ± 600 KB!</td>      <td>± 130 KB</td>      <td>± 60 KB</td>    </tr>    <tr>      <th scope=\"row\">Difficulty</th>      <td>Takes a lot of time</td>      <td>Not that easy</td>      <td>Easy peasy</td>    </tr>  </tbody></table><p>  This will give you an idea of these frameworks. For beginners, I would suggest  using Vue.js, just like I did. It is really powerful and fast, especially in  combination with Vuetify. It will give you almost anything you need and is  relatively simple to learn. Over the last few years it has become more and more popular.</p><h3 class=\"font-weight-bold\">Tell me more about Angular Material</h3><p>  Angular Material is a design framework for UX/UI components. It will let you  implement interactive and visual good looking components like toolbars,  buttons, forms, cards, dialogs, etc. And all of this, with minimal of CSS for  you! Isn't that perfect.</p><p>  In this blog, I use it in combination with Bootstrap. Material is in some ways  limited, where Bootstrap strikes in.</p><h3 class=\"font-weight-bold\">Let's reflect</h3><p>  After making the basics of this website, I can say that I feel comfortable with  Angular and material. I have had few problems and did not have a hard time  adjusting my thinking. Probably because I already had experience with Vue.js.  Material is really fantastic, yet it doesn't meet what I expect from a UI  framework. The only thing that bothers me is the relative long loading time of Angular. Right now, the load time of  the home page of this website is <b>1.6 seconds</b> and it has a page size of <b>759.0 KB</b>. I think that is still a  bit to long for this simple and lightweight website. I will keep improving this!</p><p>  I am absolutely happy with the result I created within a few hours and wouldn't  really change much.</p>",

            "text": "<p>  A good friend (<a href=\"https://casper.wvg.be\" target=\"_blank\">Casper Haems</a>) and I were instructed by a local non-profit organization to upgrade  their webcam. At that time, they had a camera mounted that took a picture every minute  and published it on their website. This camera was portforwarded and therefore  publicly available to everyone, which is absolutely not necessary in this  situation. On top of that, it used default credentials, the software of the  camera was outdated and probably had a ton of vulnerabilities and didn't  function 100% anymore.</p><p>  Without discussing it, Casper and I knew that we wouldn't use a commercial  webcam but would work with a Raspberry Pi and a small webcam instead. This  because a Raspberry is relatively cheap, powerful and customizable compared to  a commercial webcam. Also because implementation would be more flexible and we  would not have to deal with outdated software as we would write it ourselves. The only problem is, that if YouTube changes its API, we could have some trouble.</p><h3 class=\"font-weight-bold\">How it works</h3><p>  When a user starts the livestream from the website using a button, a value is  changed in the database. The Raspberry Pi will notice this and depending on  the value, start or stop livestreaming.</p><p>  When the Raspberry Pi is streaming, it and the user will constantly turn the  toggle in the database on and off. When the user leaves the website, the  toggle will not be changed by the user and the picam will stop streaming after  a certain amount of time. Then the livestream value in the database will also  be turned off again. Ready for the next stream!</p><p>Here is a visual overview of how the system works.</p><div class=\"text-center\">  <img    src=\"/assets/images/blog/picam.gif\"    class=\"img-fluid rounded mb-3 w-75\"  /></div><p>And here what is looks like for the user;</p>  <div class=\"text-center\">    <img      src=\"/assets/images/blog/picam-frontend.webp\"      class=\"img-fluid rounded mb-3 w-75\"    />  </div><h3 class=\"font-weight-bold\">The software</h3><p>  This is the code on the Raspberry Pi.

In the beginning,  we used FireBase, but we would get a quota exceeded error, so we switch to an  MySQL database. We have also received a request from another organization that  we have not discussed yet if we could accept. At the time of writing this  post, there are 1500+ videos made by the picam. For privacy reasons we  regularly put videos private so we don't create a platform with years of video  footage, even though most of the people visible on the footage are barely  recognizable.</p><p>Update Sept. 19th 2020:<br> On September 12th around 15h00, we noticed a problem. YouTube could't display the iframe of the livestream anymore. After reading some API documentation, and not finding any updates since 2019 that could be the reason of the inoperative Pi, we concluded that the best thing we could do is change streaming platform. From now on, we are using Twitch.tv.</p>",
