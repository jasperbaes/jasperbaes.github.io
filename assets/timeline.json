            "text": "<h2>TL;DR</h2> <p>Privileged Identity Management (PIM) is a powerful service in Microsoft Entra, but it just doesn't meet my level of expectations. It is not actually Just-in-Time (JiT), administrators are often still overprivileged, and privileged tokens remain unnecessarily on their devices. This blog and video are my concept for a better version of PIM.</p> <h2>Nice to meet you, PIM!</h2> <p>Microsoft tenants with an Entra P2 license can use Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to assign administrative roles. These roles grant the user account access to Entra resources or Azure resources. Major benefits of PIM are that the assigned roles can be Just-in-Time, can require approval, can require Multi-Factor Authentication upon activation, alert other admins or the SOC, have expiration periods and offer a track record of privilege elevations.</p> <p>I personally love using Privileged Identity Management every day. It works well and offers extensive customization options to meet the unique needs of organizations. PIM also checks numerous security and compliance audit boxes, making it worth an Entra P2 license. One of the fundamental concepts is the ability to assign roles permanently or set them as eligible, with expiration dates. This flexibility ensures that administrators have the appropriate access when needed.</p> <p>Another feature I particularly like is its integration with Conditional Access. Administrators can PIM into a group that is used in a Conditional Access policy. This means the administrator is not permanently excluded from the policy, allowing for temporary exceptions. This works great for exceptions in Conditional Access policies like: legacy authentication exceptions, phishing-resistant MFA exceptions, exceptions to have access from a PAW devices, exception to use device code flow, exception to use a Linux device, ...</p> <p>While attackers can also activate PIM roles when they gain control of an administrative account, preventing this isn't the primary goal of PIM. The main advantage lies in improved visibility and detecting misuse of administrative roles. By requiring (phishing-resistant) Multi-Factor Authentication when activating a PIM role and implementing a robust set of Conditional Access policies, certain attack paths can be effectively blocked.</p> <h2>Under the hood of PIM</h2> <p>Before we look at where PIM might come short, let's break down how it works.</p> <p>When using the Microsoft admin portals, they reach out to the back-end Microsoft servers for data. Most of the time, the Microsoft Graph API is used to gather this data. For each incoming data request, the back-end service needs to verify the identity that is requesting the data. For this, it uses access tokens that are included in the header of the request.</p> <p>An access tokens is a JWT (base64 encoded JSON object) that stores context about the user identity and its permissions. A JWT contains three segments separated by the . character: the header, the body and the signature. This access token can't be altered or tweaked because they are signed by Entra ID using public-private key pairs. Entra ID rotates the keys on a periodic basis. (https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/discovery/keys)</p> <p>When decrypting an access token, we get something like this:</p> <img class='w-100 rounded' src='/assets/images/timeline/access-token-pim.png'/> <p>When an administrator activates an administrative role via PIM, a new access token is generated by Entra. This access token includes the permissions of the activated role (Figure 2). For the activated role to take effect, the browser tab needs to be refreshed and from then on, the new access token is used. When approval is needed for the PIM role to be activated or when using multiple tabs, the browser tab(s) might not refresh by themselves. This often causes frustration or confusion among administrators.</p> <h2>Are you really trying your best, PIM?</h2> <p>Microsoft offers PIM as a security and governance solution, but as a consultant, I see some issues happening in reality:</p> <ul><li><b>PIM is not really Just-in-Time (JiT):</b> <br> Microsoft claims that PIM offers Just-in-Time privileged roles to administrators. While this is true, in reality, most administrators enable their PIM role for the entire day without providing a meaningful justification. This bypasses the purpose of eligible role assignment. </li> <li><b>PIM does not help administrator with least privileges:</b> <br> Each Entra RBAC role has its permissions and use cases. However, there are so many Entra roles that administrators often don‚Äôt know which role they need, let alone the least privileged role they should use. The same can apply for PIM role activations. It can be difficult to know which role you need to activate for a specific task. This might result in over-privileged administrators, and to be honest, I‚Äôm guilty of this too. </li> <li><b>Token theft and token reuse is a real issue:</b> <br> In recent years, there has been an increase in token theft and token reuse attacks. Tokens with privileged permissions are particularly attractive to attackers. If attackers gain access to such a privileged tokens, they immediately have administrative permissions in Entra without needing to perform any additional PIM steps like approval or Multi-Factor authentication (MFA). If PIM is not yet activated, the attacker can just wait for the administrator to elevate, and they will get elevated too. </li></ul> <h2>Take an example from Windows</h2> <p>Just before Microsoft Ignite in November 2024, the Microsoft Windows team announced Administrator Protection in Windows. With this upcoming feature, the user can‚Äôt be a Local Administrator. Instead, the user elevates the user-space for a fraction of a second when Local Administrator permissions are needed (Figure 3). The privileged administrator token only exists while performing the privileged action, reducing the impact of a leaked token or device takeover.</p> <img class='w-50 rounded text-center' src='/assets/images/timeline/allow-this-app-to-make-changes-to-the-device.webp'/> <p>This got me thinking: why is this not the case for PIM?</p> <p>Why does PIM not use the same approach? Why is PIM not destroying privileged tokens? Why is PIM not using Windows Hello for Business Facial Recognition?</p> <h2>Concept of a better PIM</h2> <p>This is my idea of what PIM should look like:</p> <p>A privileged PIM session should be created only for the specific privileged action an administrator needs to perform. When performing the action, a popup appears to elevate to a just-in-time PIM action (Figure 4). Automatically, the least-privileged role that the administrator has assigned is used. After the action is completed, the privileged token is immediately destroyed and cannot be reused. With this single use of privileged tokens, there is no need for the token to be on the administrator‚Äôs device or browser. The token can stay on Microsoft‚Äôs servers, drastically reducing the attack surface of the administrator.</p> <img class='w-50 rounded' src='/assets/images/timeline/privileged-pim-popup.png'/> <p>Having a PIM concept like this implemented would bring the following benefits:</p> <ul> <li>Truly Just-in-Time</li> <li>Least privileges</li> <li>More useful activation justifications and a more accurate audit track</li> <li>Attack surface reduction as the privileged token is only accessible by Microsoft</li> <li>Better change management and more clear context (e.g. for SOC or audits)</li> <li>No need to refresh browser tabs, use incognito tabs or do a re-login</li> </ul> <p>This concept would not work for every use case, such as Entra roles that are read-only. Generating a privileged token for each read request the Entra Portal makes to the Microsoft Graph API would be reducing productivity. For these cases, a privileged token with only the read permissions should be kept in the administrator‚Äôs browser. Another case where this concept would not work is when the administrator is using a script to perform an action. In the case where an administrator needs to perform a privileged action dozens of times, the previously used justification and MFA claim could be satisfied automatically. Or Windows Hello for Business facial recognition could be used instead on managed devices.</p> <p>Implementing this concept would require significant changes to the existing PIM infrastructure. PIM is deeply integrated into the Azure portals and the way that authentication works. This makes it close to impossible to build this concept as a tool or browser extension. Having this implemented by Microsoft is also not as easy as it may seem.</p> <p>As someone who loves working with Microsoft‚Äôs services daily, I frequently think about improvements and have feedback to potentially make Microsoft products even better. Discussing these ideas with the community drives growth, which is why I‚Äôm sharing this concept. Just as a tech reviewer on YouTube would do. In no way, this is to criticize the current implementation of PIM or the Entra product team, but rather to spark a conversation about how it can be enhanced for better security and usability.</p> <p>What do you think?</p>",

The post pointed out that many Ignite sessions focused on Copilot and AI. It's clear that Microsoft is investing heavily in this and pushing for adoption. While not everyone agrees with this direction, that's okay.</p> <p>During Ignite, this (marketing) focus was evident, and many attendees, including some Microsoft employees, found it overwhelming. However, I believe Microsoft is heading in the right direction technologically. The implementation of Copilot (particularly with DLP) is showing great potential. With the M365 suite, Microsoft is well-equipped to create a seamless integration and product; although it may take some time. The marketing push can feel overwhelming, especially at this early stage. Microsoft's proactive approach demonstrates their commitment and belief. Remember, Microsoft is working on features and implementations that we, as users, may not yet be aware of or have seen.</p>",
